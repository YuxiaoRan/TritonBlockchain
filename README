1) design of myHash(String value) in HashTable.java:
    The hash function I implement in HashTable.java utilizes ASCII table 
to convert each character in the input String to an int, and multiplies it 
by a number that is generated based on the character's index. I vastly make 
use of prime numbers as multipliers in this algorithm to make sure my function 
is deterministic. Finally, I add these numbers up and mod the sum by the 
table size to get the final hash value.

2) design of hashBlock() in TritonBlock.java:
    As I notice that the hash values in the example output can be String forms 
of big numbers and negative numbers, I decide to use each block's timestamp, 
which is generally a big long value and varies in milliseconds, as the base 
of my hash function. Since long values could store more information than int 
values, I convert timestamps to int by continuously deviding them by a prime 
number. I also notice that each block could have a unique index and a unique 
proofId, so I use these two properties and prime numbers in my algorithm to 
grant my hash function randomization and uniqueness.

3) proof of work task in TritonBlockChain.java:
    I do this part simply by referring to the algorithm provided in the 
writeup, which is to generate a new proofId by finding the least common 
multiple of the previous proofId and a prime number.
